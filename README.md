Another good light tutorial:

On above video, last step of using the scriptable render object
1) Open Windows > Package Manager & install Universal RP
2) Create a "Rendering > URP Asset (with 2D Renderer)"
3) "New Universal Render Pipeline Asset" is your "LightweightRenderPipelineAsset" and "New Universal Render Pipeline Asset_Renderer" is your "CustomForwardRendererData". I added these names in () to easily follow the video.
4) Go "Edit > Project Settings" and on the "Graphics" tab drag in your LightweightRenderPipelineAsset
5) On the CustomForwardRendererData go "Add Renderer Feature > Render Objects" 3 times and set your settings like Mask, BehindMask and Black in the video
